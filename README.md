# Page Finder Python 3 Script

Python3 script that searches for a few interesting web pages. This script is currently hard coded to search only on port 8080, but that can easily be modified in the code.


----------------------


This script works in the following way:

1. Prompts for IP range and number of threads (note: ulimit -n will show you the max number of threads currently configured on your device; that number can be increased)
2. Attempts a socket connection to hosts in the provided IP range
3. Builds a list of all hosts it was able to successfully connect to port 8080 on
4. For each host in the list (#3 above), the script searches for the following interesting pages:

*Jenkins unauthenticated script console page (/script)

*Tomcat HTML Manager page (/manager/html)

*Tomcat Text Manager page (/manager/text)

*/Console page (such as what is used by the Werkzeug debugger)

*/Command page (any interesting pages)

Usage:
-pip3 install -r requirements.txt

-python3 page-hunter.py
